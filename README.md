### Hi there 👋

## About me
My name is Gabriel, I'm 21 and I'm from Brazil. I've been away for a few months due to personal reasons, but I'm coming back more excited than ever to learn more about programming. I really enjoy logical reasoning and I love coding. Soon I'm putting more projects here! I'm currently open to new jobs opportunities.

## What I'm studying to remember 
HTML/CSS | Python 

## Languages I will soon be learning:
Javascript | Golang
