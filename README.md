### Hi there 👋

## About me 💻
My name is Gabriel, I'm 21 and I'm from Brazil. I use this GitHub repository for storing my mini-projects, exercises, coursework projects, and other similar projects. I've been away for a few months due to personal reasons, but I'm coming back more excited than ever to learn more about programming. Soon I'm putting more projects here! I'm currently open to new jobs opportunities.

## What I'm studying to remember ✍🏻
HTML/CSS | Python 

## Languages I will soon be learning 📖
Javascript | Golang

## My repositories 📁
Most of them are projects from frontendmentor.io, while the rest are from courses I've finished.
